# Team Builder

This is a team composition simulator for League of Legends made with `Typescript` and `React`
## The features you can expect from this:
On the frontpage you can set your desired team composition by clicking on the champion icons and selecting their lane. You can sort them out by which lanes they are usually played on as well for easier searching.
On the header you can swap between the front page and a player search thats usable by searching for someone by their riot name AND their riot tag divided by a # symbol (example: nightowl#8512).
